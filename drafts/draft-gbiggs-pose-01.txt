Abstract

   This RRFC describes a data layout for storing pose data of a
   two-dimensional planar robot. This data layout is useful for
   operation between software components within a framework, for
   inter-operation between frameworks, and for preserving data in log
   files.

1.  Introduction

   The purpose of this RRFC is to define the storage of pose data for a
   2D planar robot. It does not enumerate how that data should be
   accessed by software at the framework- or library-user level.
   Instead, it aims to define a structure of the data itself usable in
   intra- and inter-operation, and in preserving data to log files.

   Two formats are specified. One is for use by in-memory data
   structures in transferring data between software components. The
   other is for use by log files.


2.  Data structure

2.1  Wire format

   struct Pose2D
   {
       float x
       float y
       float a
   }

   where:

   - x is the position of the robot along the X axis, in metres.
   - y is the position of the robot along the Y axis, in metres.
   - a is the rotation of the robot around the Y axis, in radians, with
   	 positive values indicating a counter-clockwise rotation.

   All values are in a left-handed coordinate system.

   "float" is defined as an IEEE floating-point value.

2.2  Log format

   This format is serialised in binary form to a log file.

   serialised ::= "pose2d" x y a
   x ::= float
   y ::= float
   a ::= float
   float ::= IEEE floating-point value

   where:

   - x is the position of the robot along the X axis, in metres.
   - y is the position of the robot along the Y axis, in metres.
   - a is the rotation of the robot around the Y axis, in radians, with
   	 positive values indicating a counter-clockwise rotation.

   All values are in a left-handed coordinate system.

   "float" is defined as an IEEE floating-point value.

   Each value is serialised in little-endian format. No padding is used
   between or around the values.


3. Security Considerations

   Security issues are not discussed in this memo.
