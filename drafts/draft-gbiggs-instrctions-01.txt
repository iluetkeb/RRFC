1.  Introduction

   This Robotics Request for Comments (RRFC) provides information about the
   preparation of RRFCs, and certain policies relating to the publication
   of RRFCs.

   The RRFC series of notes covers a broad range of interests.  The core
   topic is robotics.  However, any related topic may be acceptable at
   the discretion of the RRFC Editor.

   Memos proposed to be RRFCs may be submitted by anyone.  Potential
   RRFCs are reviewed and voted on by the community using the RRFC
   mailing list. Once an RRFC is considered ready for publication, it is
   sent to the RRFC Editor.

   RRFCs are distributed online by being stored as public access files,
   and a short message is sent to the distribution list indicating the
   availability of the memo.

   The online files are copied by the interested people and printed or
   displayed at their site on their equipment.  This means that the
   format of the online files must meet the constraints of a wide
   variety of printing and display equipment.  (RRFCs may also be
   returned via e-mail in response to an e-mail query, or RRFCs may be
   found using information and database searching tools such as Gopher,
   Wais, or the World Wide Web (WWW)).

   RRFCs have been traditionally published and continue to be published
   in ASCII text.

   While the primary RRFCs is always an ASCII text file, secondary or
   alternative versions of RRFC may be provided in HTML.  This decision
   is motivated by the desire to include diagrams, drawings, and such in
   RRFCs.  HTML documents are visually more appealing and have better
   readability.

   HTML was chosen for the fancy form of RRFC publication over other
   possible systems because of the widespread availability of HTML
   display tools.


2.  Editorial Policy

   Documents proposed to be RRFCs are reviewed by the RRFC Editor and
   possibly by other reviewers he selects.

   The result of the review may be to suggest to the author some
   improvements to the document before publication.

   In some cases it may be determined that the submitted document is not
   appropriate material to be published as an RRFC.

   In some cases it may be necessary to include in the document a
   statement based on the reviews about the ideas in the document.  This
   may be done in the case that the document suggests relevant but
   inappropriate or unsafe ideas, and other situations.

   The RRFC Editor may make minor changes to the document, especially in
   the areas of style and format, but on some occasions also to the
   text.  Sometimes the RRFC Editor will undertake to make more
   significant changes, especially when the format rules (see below) are
   not followed.  However, more often the memo will be returned to the
   author for the additional work.

   Generally, the documents in question are Robotics Drafts.  The
   communication usually cites the exact Robotics Draft in question (by
   file name).  The RRFC Editor must assume that only that file is to be
   processed to become the RRFC.  If the authors have small corrections
   to the text, they should be sent to the RRFC Editor separately (or as
   a "diff"), authors should not send a new version of the document.

   In some cases, authors prepare alternate secondary versions of RRFCs
   in fancy format using HTML.  Since the ASCII text version of the RRFC
   is the primary version, the HTML version must match the text version.
   The RRFC Editor must decide if the HTML version is "the same as" the
   ASCII version before the HTML version can be published.

   The effect of this is that the RRFC Editor first processes the ASCII
   version of the memo through to publication as an RRFC.  If the author
   wishes to submit a HTML version at that point that matches the ASCII
   version (and the RRFC Editor agrees that it does), then the HTML
   version will be installed in the RRFC repositories and announced to
   the community.

   Due to various time pressures on the RRFC Editorial staff, the time
   elapsed between submission and publication can vary greatly.  It is
   always acceptable to query (ping) the RRFC Editor about the status of
   an RRFC during this time (but not more than once a week).


3.  Format Rules

   To meet the distribution constraints, the following rules are
   established for the two allowed formats for RRFCs:  ASCII and HTML.

   The RRFC Editor attempts to ensure a consistent RRFC style.  To do this
   the RRFC Editor may choose to reformat the RRFC submitted.  It is much
   easier to do this if the submission matches the style of the most
   recent RRFCs.  Please do look at some recent RRFCs and prepare yours in
   the same style.

   You must submit an editable online document to the RRFC Editor.  The
   RRFC Editor may require or make minor changes in format or style and
   will insert the actual RRFC number.

   Most of the RRFCs are processed by the RRFC Editor with the unix
   "nroff" program using a very simple set of the formatting commands
   (or "requests") from the "ms" macro package (see the Appendix).  If a
   memo submitted to be an RRFC has been prepared by the author using
   nroff, it is very helpful to let the RRFC Editor know that when it is
   submitted.

   3a.  ASCII Format Rules

      The character codes are ASCII.

      Each page must be limited to 58 lines followed by a form feed on a
      line by itself.

      Each line must be limited to 72 characters followed by carriage
      return and line feed.

      No overstriking (or underlining) is allowed.

      These "height" and "width" constraints include any headers,
      footers, page numbers, or left side indenting.

      Do not fill the text with extra spaces to provide a straight right
      margin.

      Do not do hyphenation of words at the right margin.

      Do not use footnotes.  If such notes are necessary, put them at
      the end of a section, or at the end of the document.

      Use single spaced text within a paragraph, and one blank line
      between paragraphs.

      Note that the number of pages in a document and the page numbers
      on which various sections fall will likely change with
      reformatting.  Thus cross references in the text by section number
      usually are easier to keep consistent than cross references by
      page number.

      RRFCs in ASCII Format may be submitted to the RRFC Editor in e-mail
      messages (or as online files) in either the finished publication
      format or in nroff.  If you plan to submit a document in nroff
      please consult the RRFC Editor first.

   3b.  HTML Format Rules

      Limit source lines to 72 characters to facilitate diffs.

      <Fill this in with some good HTML guidelines. Headings to use and
      so on.>

      Note that the number of pages in a document and the page numbers
      on which various sections fall will likely differ in the ASCII and
      the HTML versions.  Thus cross references in the text by section
      number usually are easier to keep consistent than cross references
      by page number.

      These HTML rules are likely to changed and expanded as experience
      is gained.

      RRFCs in HTML Format may be submitted to the RRFC Editor in e-mail
      messages (or as online files).  If you plan to submit a document
      in HTML please consult the RRFC Editor first.

      Note that since the ASCII text version of the RRFC is the primary
      version, the HTML version must match the text version.  The RRFC
      Editor must decide if the HTML version is "the same as" the ASCII
      version before the HTML version can be published.


4.  Headers and Footers

   There is the first page heading, the running headers, and the running
   footers.

   4a.  First Page

      Please see the front page of this memo for an example of the front
      page heading.  On the first page there is no running header.  The
      top of the first page has the following items:

      Robotics Engineering Task Force

         The traditional heading for the group that founded the RRFC
         series.  This appears on the first line on the left hand side
         of the heading.

      Robotics Request for Comments: nnnn

         Identifies this as a request for comments and specifies the
         number.  Indicated on the second line on the left side.  The
         actual number is filled in at the last moment before
         publication by the RRFC Editor.

      Author

         The author's name (first initial and last name only) indicated
         on the first line on the right side of the heading.

      Organization

         The author's organization, indicated on the second line on the
         right side.

      Date

         This is the Month and Year of the RRFC Publication. Indicated on
         the third line on the right side.

      Updates or Obsoletes

         If this RRFC Updates or Obsoletes another RRFC, this is indicated
         as third line on the left side of the heading.

      Category

         The category of this RRFC, one of: Best Current Practice,
         Informational, or Experimental.  This is indicated on the third
         (if there is no Updates or Obsoletes indication) or fourth line
         of the left side.

      Other Numbers

         Other numbers in the RRFC series of notes include the subseries
         of BCP (Best Current Practice) [1].  These are placed on the
         left side.

      Title

         The title appears, centered, below the rest of the heading.
         Periods or "dots" in the titles are not allowed.

      If there are multiple authors and if the multiple authors are from
      multiple organizations the right side heading may have additional
      lines to accommodate them and to associate the authors with the
      organizations properly.

   4b.  Running Headers

      The running header in one line (on page 2 and all subsequent
      pages) has the RRFC number on the left (RRFC NNNN), the (possibly
      nshortened form) title centered, and the date (Month Year) on the
      right.

   4c.  Running Footers

      The running footer in one line (on all pages) has the author's
      last name on the left, category centered, and the page number on
      the right ([Page N]).

5.  Status Section

   Each RRFC must include on its first page the "Status of this Memo"
   section which contains two elements: (1) a paragraph describing the
   type of the RRFC, and (2) the distribution statement.

   The content of this section will be one of the four following
   statements.

   Best Current Practice

      "This document specifies a Robotics Best Current Practices for the
      Robotics Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
      improvements.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited."

   General

      "This memo provides information for the Robotics community
      describing a common technology or concept.  This memo does not
      specify a robotics standard of any kind.  Distribution of this
      memo is unlimited."

   Experimental

      "This memo defines an Experimental System for the Robotics
      community.  This memo does not specify a robotics standard of any
      kind.  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested.
      Distribution of this memo is unlimited."

   Informational

      "This memo provides information for the Robotics community.  This
      memo does not specify a robotics standard of any kind.
      Distribution of this memo is unlimited."

6.  Copyright Notice

   Immediately following the Status section the statement, "Copyright
   (C) Someone (date).  All Rights Reserved." is placed.  Also, see
   Section 11 for the full statement that must appear at the end of the
   document.

7.  Introduction Section

   Each RRFC should have an Introduction section that (among other
   things) explains the motivation for the RRFC and (if appropriate)
   describes the applicability of the protocol described.

      Normally, this will be the "abstract" section from the Robotics
      Draft.  If the RRFC is not based on an R-D, other possibilities
      are:

         Protocol

            This protocol is intended to provide the bla-bla service,
            and be used between robots and robotic systems.

            or

            This protocol is intended to provide the bla-bla service,
            and be used between special purpose units such as laser
            sensors and sensor data processors.

         Discussion

            The purpose of this RRFC is to focus discussion on
            particular problems in Robotics and possible methods of
            solution.  No proposed solutions in this document are
            intended as standards for robotics.  Rather, it is hoped
            that a general consensus will emerge as to the appropriate
            solution to such problems, leading eventually to the
            adoption of an RRFC.

         Interest

            This RRFC is being distributed to members of the robotics
            community in order to solicit their reactions to the
            proposals contained in it.  While the issues discussed may
            not be directly relevant to the research problems of
            robotics, they may be interesting to a number of researchers
            and implementers.

         Status Report

            In response to the need for maintenance of current
            information about the status and progress of various
            projects in the robotics community, this RRFC is issued for
            the benefit of community members.  The information contained
            in this document is accurate as of the date of publication,
            but is subject to change.  Subsequent RRFCs will reflect such
            changes.

      These paragraphs need not be followed word for word, but the
      general intent of the RRFC must be made clear.


8.  References Section

   Nearly all RRFCs contain citations to other documents, and these are
   listed in a References section near the end of the RRFC.  There are
   many styles for references, and the RRFCs have one of their own.
   Please follow the reference style used in recent RRFCs.  See the
   reference section of this RRFC for an example.

   In many documents several words are used to signify the requirements
   in the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  BCP 2,
   RRFC 3 [1], defines these words as they should be interpreted in RRFC
   documents.

9.  Security Considerations Section

   All RRFCs must contain a section near the end of the document that
   discusses the security considerations of the protocol or procedures
   that are the main topic of the RRFC.

10.  Author's Address Section

   Each RRFC must have at the very end a section giving the author's
   address, including the name and postal address, the telephone number,
   (optional: a FAX number) and the Internet email address.

11.  Copyright Section

   <This is as-is from the original IETF document. We *need* to figure
   out what to do with it.>

   Per BCP 9, RRFC 2026 [2], "The following copyright notice and
   disclaimer shall be included in all ISOC standards-related
   documentation."  The following statement should be placed on the last
   page of the RRFC, as the "Full Copyright Statement".

      WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

12.  Relation to other RRFCs

   Sometimes an RRFC adds information on a topic discussed in a previous
   RRFC or completely replaces an earlier RRFC.  There are two terms used
   for these cases respectively, Updates and Obsoletes.  A document that
   obsoletes an earlier document can stand on its own.  A document that
   merely updates an earlier document cannot stand on its own; it is
   something that must be added to or inserted into the previously
   existing document, and has limited usefulness independently.

   Updates

      To be used as a reference from a new item that cannot be used
      alone (i.e., one that supplements a previous document), to refer
      to the previous document.  The newer publication is a part that
      will supplement or be added on to the existing document; e.g., an
      addendum, or separate, extra information that is to be added to
      the original document.

   Obsoletes

      To be used to refer to an earlier document that is replaced by
      this document.  This document contains either revised information,
      or else all of the same information plus some new information,
      however extensive or brief that new information is; i.e., this
      document can be used alone, without reference to the older
      document.

      For example:

         On the Assigned Numbers RFCs the term Obsoletes should be used
         since the new document actually incorporate new information
         (however brief) into the text of existing information and is
         more up-to-date than the older document, and hence, replaces it
         and makes it Obsoletes.

   In lists of RRFCs or the RRFC-Index (but not on the RRFCs themselves)
   the following may be used with early documents to point to later
   documents.

   Obsoleted-by

      To be used to refer to the newer document(s) that replaces the
      older document.

   Updated-by

      To be used to refer to the newer section(s) which are to be added
      to the existing, still used, document.

13.  Acceptance and publishing process

   The established procedure is that when a submitter completes work on
   a Robitics Draft that is to become an RRFC, they will notify the
   Voting Managers. The VM will then set a timeline for voting, during
   which time members of the RRFC mailing list may submit their vote to
   the list in the form of an email containing ONE ONLY of the
   following:

      +1
      +0
      -0
      -1

   The meanings of which are:

      +1 Vote for publication
      +0 Don't care if published
      -0 Don't care if not published
      -1 Vote for rejection

   The VM then tallies up the votes, and successful documents are
   submitted to the RRFC Editor for publication. Documents that fail a
   vote may remain as Robotics Drafts and be re-submitted for voting at
   a later date. Acceptance of a Robotics Draft for voting is at the
   discretion of the VM; a typical reason for rejection is no
   significant changes being made since a failed vote.

   The VM communicates to the RRFC the exact Robotics Draft to publish
   (by file name).  The RRFC Editor must assume that only that file is
   to be processed to become the RRFC.  If the authors have small
   corrections to the text, they should be sent to the RRFC Editor
   separately (or as a "diff"), do not send a new version of the
   document.

14.  Contact

   To contact the RRFC Editor send an email message to:

         "rfc-editor@<fill-this-in.com>".


15.  Distribution Lists

   The RRFC announcements are distributed via the RRFC-Announce mailing
   list.

   To join (or quit) the RRFC-Announce list send a message to <fill this
   in>.


16.  RRFC Index

   Several organizations maintain RRFC Index files, generally using the
   file name "rrfc-index.txt".  The contents of such a file copied from
   one site may not be identical to that copied from another site.


17.  Acknowledgements

   This document is based heavily on RFC 2223 from the IETF. See [2].


17.  Security Considerations

   This RRFC raises no security issues (however, see Section 9).

20.  Appendix - RRFC "nroff macros"

   Generally, we use the very simplest nroff features.  We use the "ms"
   macros.  So, "nroff -ms input-file > output-file".  However, we could
   not get nroff to do the right thing about putting a form feed after
   the last visible line on a page and no extra line feeds before the
   first visible line of the next page.  We want:

        last visible line on page i
        ^L
        first visible line on page i+1

   So, we invented a hack to fix this.  We use a perl script called
   "fix.pl".  So the command to process the file becomes:

        nroff -ms input-file | fix.pl > output-file

   The actual perl script is:


#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#! /local/bin/perl

# fix.pl  17-Nov-93  Craig Milo Rogers at USC/ISI
#
#       The style guide for RRFCs calls for pages to be delimited by the
# sequence <last-non-blank-line><formfeed-line><first-non-blank-line>.
# Unfortunately, NROFF is reluctant to produce output that conforms to
# this convention.  This script fixes RRFC-style documents by searching
# for the token "FORMFEED[Page", replacing "FORMFEED" with spaces,
# appending a formfeed line, and deleting white space up to the next
# non-white space character.
#
#       There is one difference between this script's output and that of
# the "fix.sh" and "pg" programs it replaces:  this script includes a
# newline after the formfeed after the last page in a file, whereas the

A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers

Status of this Memo

.fi
.in 3
This memo describes an experimental method for the encapsulation of IP
datagrams in avian carriers.  This specification is primarily useful
in Metropolitan Area Networks.  This is an experimental, not recommended
standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Overview and Rational

Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low
altitude service.  The connection topology is limited to a single
point-to-point path for each carrier, used with standard carriers, but
many carriers can be used without significant interference with each
other, outside of early spring.  This is because of the 3D ether space
available to the carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used by
IEEE802.3.  The carriers have an intrinsic collision avoidance system,
which increases availability.  Unlike some network technologies, such
as packet radio, communication is not limited to line-of-sight
distance.  Connection oriented service is available in some cities,
usually based upon a central hub topology.

Frame Format

The IP datagram is printed, on a small scroll of paper, in
hexadecimal, with each octet separated by whitestuff and blackstuff.
The scroll of paper is wrapped around one leg of the avian carrier.
A band of duct tape is used to secure the datagram's edges.  The
bandwidth is limited to the leg length.  The MTU is variable, and
paradoxically, generally increases with increased carrier age.  A
typical MTU is 256 milligrams.  Some datagram padding may be needed.

Upon receipt, the duct tape is removed and the paper copy of the
datagram is optically scanned into a electronically transmittable
form.

Discussion

Multiple types of service can be provided with a prioritized pecking
order.  An additional property is built-in worm detection and
eradication.  Because IP only guarantees best effort delivery, loss of
a carrier can be tolerated.  With time, the carriers are
self-regenerating.  While broadcasting is not specified, storms can
cause data loss.  There is persistent delivery retry, until the
carrier drops.  Audit trails are automatically generated, and can
often be found on logs and cable trays.

Security Considerations

.in 3
Security is not generally a problem in normal operation, but special
measures must be taken (such as data encryption) when avian carriers
are used in a tactical environment.
